            <h3>Your brain is built for <i>space</i></h3>
            Neuroscience discovered that the human brain uses space, the 3-D environments in which we live, to provide context for information. If the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus>part of your brain</a> that represents space is damaged, then you will be unable to store new memories.
            <h3>What happens when information is removed from space?</h3>
            This experiment is currently ongoing, and we are all subjects. Modern life is dominated by screens, the two-dimensional glass rectangles through which we access and interact with all digital information.

            Humans need a way to interact with digital information, and each other, in space. We have recently developed a new technology that achieves this using a network of miniature laser projectors to control all of the light in a room. We call this a <i>Voight-Kampff Space</i>.
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            We use light projection to display digital images on every surface in a room. However, the digital light projection technology currently available has a major flaw.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img id="shadow-man" src="resources/images/technology/shadow_man.png"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            When users interact with the projected display, they block the source of light and cast a shadow. This not only breaks the illusion that the projected image is <i>part</i> of the surface, but it is difficult for users to interact with the display.
            <br>
            <br>
            Removing shadows from a projection display requires that every surface is illuminated from multiple directions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img id="VK-views" src="resources/images/technology/VK_views.gif"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            With just two projectors, shadow intensity is reduced by half and the user experience vastly improved.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img id="VK-views" src="resources/images/technology/VK_views.png"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            Illuminating the same surface from multiple directions requires that the projectors are positioned at different angles relative to the surface. However, conventional light projectors have a single focus plane that is perpendicular to the projection direction. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To solve this problem, Voight-Kampff uses laser-beam steering projectors, which do not have a fixed focal plane. The image has “infinite focus” as it is created by sweeping a narrow laser beam in a raster pattern.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img id="node-tests" src="resources/images/technology/node_tests.png"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            The first Voight-Kampff prototype consisted of four "nodes". Each node included a laser projector, camera, infrared illumination, power supply, and single-board computer. The node's components were assembled into a small case and ceiling mounted.

            <br>
            <br>
            We demonstrated this first <a href=./demos.html>proof-of-concept</a> design in 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next generation space, combining 40 redesigned nodes, is currently being constructed at Voight-Kampff's office in London, UK. It will be available for demonstration and collaboration at the end of 2021.
